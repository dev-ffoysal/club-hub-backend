# Database Seeding Guide

This guide explains how to use the database seeding functionality to populate your database with initial data for development and testing purposes.

## Overview

The seed database file (`src/database/seed.ts`) creates comprehensive initial data for all models in the project, including:

- **Users** with role-based data (Super Admin, Admin, Club, Member, Guest)
- **Universities** with sample institutions
- **Events** with complete event information
- **Advertisements** with type-specific data
- **Applications** with different statuses
- **Event Registrations** with various user types and payment statuses
- **Categories** for organizing events and clubs
- **Tags** for content categorization
- **Public Content** for essential platform pages
- **FAQs** for user support
- **Chats** and **Messages** for communication
- **Committees** for club organization
- **Follows** and **Engagements** for user interactions
- **Notifications** for user updates

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. Ensure your MongoDB database is running
2. Set up your environment variables (especially `DATABASE_URL`)
3. Install all dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`

### Running the Seed

```bash
# Using npm
npm run seed

# Using yarn
yarn seed

# Direct execution
ts-node src/database/seed.ts
```

## Important Notes

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Data Clearing
The seed script **clears all existing data** before inserting new data. Use with caution in production environments.

### üîê Security
- All users have the same password: `password123`
- Change passwords in production
- The password is properly hashed using bcrypt

### üîó Relationships
- All foreign key relationships are properly established
- ObjectId references are correctly linked between models

### üìä Data Completeness
- All required fields are populated
- Optional fields are included where relevant
- Enum values are properly used
- Nested objects and arrays are fully populated

## Customization

To customize the seed data:

1. Edit `src/database/seed.ts`
2. Modify the data objects according to your needs
3. Ensure all required fields are included
4. Maintain proper relationships between models
5. Run the seed script again

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database Connection Error**
   - Check if MongoDB is running
   - Verify `DATABASE_URL` in environment variables

2. **Validation Errors**
   - Ensure all required fields are provided
   - Check enum values match model definitions

3. **Reference Errors**
   - Verify ObjectId references exist
   - Check model relationships

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the console output for detailed error messages
2. Verify your model schemas match the seed data structure
3. Ensure all dependencies are installed
4. Check MongoDB connection and permissions

## Development Workflow

1. **Initial Setup**: Run seed after setting up the project
2. **Testing**: Use seeded data for comprehensive testing
3. **Development**: Reset data anytime during development
4. **Demo**: Use for demonstrations with realistic data

```bash
# Typical workflow
npm install
npm run seed
npm start
```

This will give you a fully populated database ready for development and testing!
